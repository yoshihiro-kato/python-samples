# Tkinter Tetris

Simple Tetris clone using Python's built-in `tkinter`.

Requirements
- Python 3.x (tkinter included in standard library on most installs)

Run
Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
python tetris.py
```

Controls
- Left / Right: move
- Up: rotate clockwise
- Z: rotate counter-clockwise
- Down: soft drop
- Space: hard drop
- P: pause
- R: restart

Notes
- No external dependencies. If `tkinter` is missing on your system, install OS-specific packages (on some Linux distributions you may need `python3-tk`).
